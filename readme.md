CodeThreat is a static application security testing(SAST) solution. It uses scientifically proven techniques with approximation to analyze a codebase at rest, collects security related information, calculates data flows, searches for various well-known security weaknesses and as a result produce claims. These claims are usually whether the targeted codebase is vulnerable to scoped weaknesses or not.

## üöÄ Roadmap

Our mission is to empower developers with a powerful Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool that seamlessly integrates into their workflows, helping them identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities from the earliest stages of development.

### Our Vision

We envision a world where secure code is not an afterthought but an intrinsic part of every developer's mindset. By building an intelligent SAST Center, we aim to enable teams to proactively detect and address security issues, bolstering the overall security posture of software projects.

### üõ£Ô∏è The Road Ahead

Our journey towards the perfect SAST solution is a dynamic and exciting one. Our roadmap outlines key milestones and enhancements that will shape the future of CodeThreat SAST Center:

1. **Advanced Rules Engine**: Expand our SAST Center's rule sets to detect even the most complex and elusive security vulnerabilities, tailored to different programming languages and frameworks.

2. **Intelligent Remediation Suggestions**: Empower developers with actionable insights by suggesting appropriate fixes and best practices to address identified security flaws.

3. **Enhanced Integrations**: Seamlessly integrate with a diverse range of version control systems, issue trackers, and CI/CD tools, providing teams with a unified security experience.

4. **Security Auditing**: Undergo rigorous security audits to ensure the highest level of resilience and fortification against potential threats.

5. **Community Engagement**: Embrace the collective wisdom of the open-source community by actively seeking feedback, feature requests, and contributions.
